<h1>Genetic Algorithm Example</h1>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>Population of particles created with a random DNA array of vectors, these are cycled through to distate how they move.
<br>Fitness of population calculated based on distance to target - Factors affecting fitness include hitting obsticle or hitting edge of screen or reaching goal, time to goal also having an impact on fitness.
<br>Mating pool generated based on this fitness with higher fitness object having more rep in mating pool.
<br>Child is chosen with mutation chance and added to new population.</p>

<h3>Things to add:</h3>
<p>Collision with edge and obsicles cause population to still move / bounce back<br>Tidy up fitness function and normalisation<br>Make obsicles an object so multiples can be added (potential for user creation)<br>Add more user input options (i.e lifespan, fitness values etc)</p>
